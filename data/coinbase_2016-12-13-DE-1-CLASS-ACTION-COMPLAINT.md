Civil Action No. ________________________________

BRANDON LEIDEL, individually, and on behalf of All Others Similarly Situated; and JAMES D. SALLAH, ESQ., as Receiver/Corporate Monitor of Project Investors, Inc. d/b/a Cryptsy,

Plaintiffs,     
 v.     

 COINBASE, INC., a Delaware corporation
  d/b/a Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX);

Defendant.      
________________________________________________/

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT Plaintiffs, BRANDON LEIDEL (“LEIDEL”), individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated (“Class Plaintiffs”), and JAMES D. SALLAH, ESQ., as Receiver/Corporate Monitor (the “Receiver”) of Project Investors, Inc. d/b/a Cryptsy (collectively the “Plaintiffs”), by and through undersigned counsel, hereby sue Defendant, COINBASE, INC., a Delaware corporation d/b/a Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX), for damages and for equitable relief. In support thereof, Plaintiffs state as follows:

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 

1. This nationwide class action is brought by Plaintiff LEIDEL, individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated users (the “Class Members”) of Project Investors, Inc. d/b/a Cryptsy (“CRYPTSY”), a cryptocurrency exchange and Money Services Business based in South Florida that served clients located both in the United States and abroad.

2. Additionally, this action is brought by the Receiver, who on April 4, 2016 was appointed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida to serve as the Receiver/Corporate Monitor over the affairs and operations of CRYPTSY and to, inter alia, “administer and manage the business affairs, funds, assets, choses in action and any other property of [CRYPTSY]; marshal and safeguard all of CRYPTSY’s assets; and take whatever actions are necessary for the protection of CRYPTSY investors and customers.” FOOTNOTE 1

3. At all material times, COINBASE operated an online business for general
consumers and the public to exchange, invest, and trade in digital cryptocurrencies. Plaintiffs seek damages based upon the unlawful conduct of COINBASE in failing to properly monitor customer accounts that held investors’ money and ignoring its duty to investigate suspicious activities under U.S. anti-money laundering rules.

4. CRYPTSY and COINBASE should have been shining examples of the
fundamental tenet of cryptocurrency: that without governmental regulation, a community of users can create and self-regulate a form of currency that serves as a viable – if not preferred -- alternative
to traditional, government-backed currency. 

5. Furthermore, CRYPTSY should have been a validation of COINBASE’s proof of concept: that a digital currency exchange is a legitimate business operation and that COINBASE could act as its liquidator. However, CRYPTSY instead proved that the loosely regulated, if not unregulated, cryptocurrency industry is still a haven for criminal activity and that those inside the industry oftentimes protect their fellow insiders.

1 See, Exhibit “A” hereto (April 4, 2016 “Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Renewed Motion for Appointment of James D. Sallah, Esq. as Receiver/Corporate Monitor over Defendant, Project Investors, Inc. d/b/a Cryptsy”). [Leidel, et al. v. Project Investors, Inc. d/b/a Cryptsy, Paul Vernon, and Lorie Ann Nettles, U.S. District Court - Southern District of Florida - Case No. 9:16-cv-80060MARRA at Docket Entry No. (“DE”) 33] (the “Receivership Order”).

6. As the facts demonstrate, an unregulated community is ripe for abuses; and even the purportedly upstanding members of that community – no matter how right-minded and honorable they appear to be on the surface – are prone to engage in criminal activity when they think they won’t be caught.

7. Plaintiffs and Class Members, and the Receiver, seek compensatory damages, exemplary and punitive damages where appropriate and allowed, and an injunction enjoining the continuation of Defendant’s unlawful conduct.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

THE PARTIES

Plaintiffs

8. Plaintiff LEIDEL is an individual domiciled in Miami, Florida and is sui juris.

9. The Receiver is an attorney approved and appointed by the District Court to serve as the Receiver for CRYPTSY and its subsidiaries, successors, and assigns. As set forth in the Receivership Order, the Receiver is empowered to, inter alia:

Initiate, defend, compromise, adjust, intervene in, dispose of, or become a party to any lawsuits or arbitrations in state, federal or foreign jurisdictions necessary to preserve or increase the assets of Cryptsy and/or on behalf of Cryptsy and for the benefit of its investors and customers against: (1) those individuals and/or entities which the Receiver may claim have wrongfully, illegally or otherwise improperly misappropriated, transferred or received any assets, properties, monies, proceeds or other items of value directly or indirectly traceable from Cryptsy, including Cryptsy and its officers, directors, employees, agents or any persons acting in concert or participation with them; or (2) any transfers of assets, properties, monies, proceeds or other items of value directly or indirectly traceable from Cryptsy investors or customers. Such actions may include, but not be limited to, seeking imposition of constructive trusts, seeking imposition of equitable liens, disgorgement of profits, recovery and/or avoidance of fraudulent transfers under Florida Statute § 726.101, et. seq. or otherwise, rescission and restitution, the collection of debts, and such Orders or other relief supported in law or equity from this Court as may be necessary to enforce this Order.

Defendant

 10. Defendant COINBASE is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. COINBASE holds itself out as a digital currency wallet and secure online platform where merchants and consumers can transact with new digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and where users can buy, sell, transfer, and store their digital currency. 

 11. COINBASE also holds itself out as a regulated and fully compliant entity, registered with the United States Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) as a Money Services Business, as that term is defined by FinCEN. 

 12. Since May 2016, COINBASE has been operating as Global Digital Asset Exchange (GDAX). GDAX is not registered with FinCEN. 

 13. According to published reports, COINBASE operates digital Bitcoin wallets for over 3 million people across the globe, including but not limited to wallet-holders in this District.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

 Subject Matter Jurisdiction

 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332, as amended by the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, because the matter in controversy exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00), exclusive of interest and costs, and is a class action in which some members of the Class are citizens of different states than Defendant. See, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) and 1332(d)(2)(A). This Court also has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367.

Personal Jurisdiction

 15. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because: (a) Defendant is operating, present, and/or doing business within this District, (b) Defendant resides within this jurisdiction, and (c) Defendant’s breaches and tortious activity occurred within this District.

 16. Defendant is licensed by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation to conduct business as a Money Transmitter (Part II) in this state, and indeed conducts such business in the state of Florida. Moreover, according to FinCEN’s records, Florida is one of the states in which Defendant conducts business as a Money Services Business. 

 17. Additionally, Defendant entered into a contract with Florida residents CRYPTSY and Paul Vernon (CRYPTSY’s CEO) when CRYPTSY and Mr. Vernon resided in this District. Traditional monies and cryptocurrencies were routinely transferred by and between CRYPTSY/Mr. Vernon and Defendant -- including deposits by Defendant into CRYPTSY’s and Mr. Vernon’s bank accounts in Florida -- and Defendant was aware that CRYPTSY/Mr. Vernon were located here and did business here. 

 18. In light of the foregoing, Defendant has purposefully availed itself of the benefits of operating in this jurisdiction; and this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Defendant.

Venue 

19. Venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 in that: (a) Defendant resides in this judicial district, and (b) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims set forth herein occurred in this judicial district. 

20. As noted above, Defendant “resides” in this judicial district as a Money Services Business that willfully and knowingly transacts business here.

21. Furthermore, as described in greater detail herein, the theft of CRYPTSY customer funds and a substantial portion of Defendant’s assistance in laundering those stolen funds occurred in this judicial district, including Defendant’s transmittal of purloined funds to CRYPTSY’s and Mr. Vernon’s bank accounts in Florida.

22. In light of the foregoing, this District is a proper venue in which to adjudicate this dispute.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL COUNTS

Paul Vernon and Cryptsy

23. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that may be traded on online exchanges for conventional currencies, including the U.S. Dollar, or used to purchase goods and services online. Bitcoin has no single administrator or central authority or repository.

24. On or about January 31, 2013, Paul Vernon (a/k/a Paul “Big Vern” Vernon) (“VERNON”) registered CRYPTSY as a “for profit” corporation in the State of Florida; and VERNON, by and through the corporation, began operating a website at the following web address: http://www.cryptsy.com.

25. At all times material hereto, VERNON resided in, operated, and directed CRYPTSY from, and interacted with COINBASE from, this District.

26. Also at all times material hereto, CRYPTSY, like COINBASE, has been registered with FinCEN as a Money Services Business.

27. CRYPTSY, as a Money Services Business, is obligated, inter alia, to keep certain financial records and allow free and unfettered access to consumer accounts. As demonstrated below, CRYPTSY has failed to do that.

28. CRYPTSY solicited members of the public to register new accounts, deposit Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency with CRYPTSY, and thereafter actively engage in the exchange and trade of Bitcoin as well as other (alternate) cryptocurrencies.

29. After a new user created an account, the user was provided a unique digital address (known as a “cryptocurrency wallet address”). Each new user funded his or her account by transferring cryptocurrency assets to his or her unique address provided by CRYPTSY.

30. A user’s account, once populated with a cryptocurrency balance, could buy, sell, or trade in alternative cryptocurrencies. All denominations of account balances for a user were listed in Bitcoin denominations, commonly styled as “BTC.”

Coinbase is Licensed as a Money Transmitter

 31. As noted above, COINBASE purports to provide cryptocurrency users a secure online location at which users can buy, sell, transfer, and store their digital currency. 

 32. COINBASE is licensed as a Money Transmitter in multiple states and territories across the United States (including, inter alia, Florida), but it is not a bank.

 33. A Money Transmitter is required to maintain federal registration as a Money Services Business and comply with federal recordkeeping and reporting requirements under the auspices of FinCEN. 

 34. As a Money Transmitter in the State of Florida, for example, COINBASE is authorized to transmit currency, monetary value, or payment instruments, either by wire, facsimile, electronic transfer, courier, the internet, or through bill payment services or other businesses that facilitate such transfer, within this country or to or from locations outside this country. 

 35. Among the federal regulatory statutes, standards, and requirements with which a Money Services Business must comply is the Bank Secrecy Act.

36. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Money Services Business (defined in 31 CFR 1010.100(ff)) is a materially different thing from a bank, which is defined in 31 CFR 1010.100(d). In fact, the Code of Federal Regulations (31 CFR 1010.100(ff)(8)(i)) specifically notes that the term “Money Services Business” shall not include a bank.

Coinbase Purports to be a Champion of Consumer Protection

 37. In February 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox -- one of the world’s leading Bitcoin exchanges -- halted its operations, blaming the disruption on technical issues and cyber-attacks. Mt. Gox later abruptly shuttered its business and filed for bankruptcy, claiming debts (including those owed to its customers) exceeding $64,000,000.00. Mt. Gox’s precipitous tumble caused the value of Bitcoin to plunge overnight and shook users’ confidence in the future stability of Bitcoin as a viable alternative currency. 

 38. In the wake of Mt. Gox’s collapse, COINBASE released a public statement pledging to “lead the way” in coming up with consumer-protection measures after the “tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox.” According to the statement:
* responsible Bitcoin exchanges are working together and are committed to the future of Bitcoin and the security of all customer funds.
* Bitcoin operators play a critical role over the Bitcoin they hold as assets for their customers. Acting as a custodian should require a high bar, including appropriate security safeguards that are independently audited and tested on a regular basis.

COINBASE touted and positioned itself to be one of those “responsible Bitcoin exchanges.”

39. As set forth herein, COINBASE -- by such statements and its conduct in general -- assumed a duty to protect and safeguard the Bitcoin of its exchange customers, such as CRYPTSY. 

Cryptsy’s Rise to Prominence

40. With Mt. Gox defunct, thousands of cryptocurrency users turned to CRYPTSY as their new, trusted cryptocurrency exchange.

41. Barely one year after it was founded, CRYPTSY experienced significant growth in both its customer base and total online trades. According to published reports, CRYPTSY’s customer base in mid-2014 swelled to approximately 230,000 registered users; its trades per day exceeded 300,000; and it made available 150 different types of digital currencies for its users to trade. 

42. CRYPTSY’s expansion, however, had its limits. CRYPTSY did not deal with fiat money (i.e., government-backed money such as the U.S. Dollar), and it needed a way to process fiat transactions for its users. 

43. As VERNON was quoted in a 2014 news report: “Our concern is, and the
government’s concern is, money laundering. So we need to kind of be the poster children of how to do [compliance] correctly. So I’m not going to launch [a fiat currency option] until I’m ready to be on the poster.”

44. Instead of having CRYPTSY launch its own fiat currency option, VERNON turned to COINBASE. 

Cryptsy and Vernon’s Accounts at Coinbase Were Vehicles of Theft

45. CRYPTSY had an account in its name at COINBASE. Likewise, VERNON had

an account in his own name at COINBASE.

46. CRYPTSY and VERNON informed COINBASE in or about July 2014 that instead of instituting a fiat currency option for CRYPTSY’s customers, CRYPTSY would continue to operate its crypto-to-crypto exchanges where its fees would be collected in Bitcoin and that CRYPTSY would use COINBASE to liquidate those Bitcoin (representing a portion of CRYPTSY’s revenues) into U.S. Dollars. COINBASE knew it was the only service provider that VERNON and CRYPTSY used for such purposes.

47. From 2014 through 2016, CRYPTSY and VERNON transferred enough Bitcoin through COINBASE (approximately $8,300,000.00 USD) to rank among COINBASE’s top liquidators of Bitcoin.

48. COINBASE failed to perform adequate “anti-money laundering” and “know your client” (combined as “AML/KYC”) procedures, as those procedures are commonly known under FinCEN guidelines and enforcement rules.

49. From 2014 through 2016, CRYPTSY and VERNON liquidated Bitcoin through COINBASE for U.S. Dollars; however, the liquidated Bitcoin were not legitimately generated revenues. Instead, those Bitcoin were stolen from CRYPTSY users in a long-running fraudulent scheme that since collapsed under the weight of its own ill-conceived structure.

50. Unbeknownst to CRYPTSY users, CRYPTSY and VERNON were stealing Bitcoin from user accounts and liquidating those Bitcoin through both CRYPTSY’s and VERNON’s accounts at COINBASE.

51. Typically, CRYPTSY and VERNON would remove Bitcoin from individual CRYPTSY customer wallets, transfer those Bitcoin to a CRYPTSY “hot wallet” FOOTNOTE 2 which VERNON controlled, send those purloined Bitcoin to either CRYPTSY’s COINBASE account or VERNON’s own COINBASE account, liquidate those Bitcoin within the respective COINBASE accounts, and then send the liquidated funds to a personal bank account at TD Bank that VERNON maintained jointly with his then-wife, Lorie Ann Nettles.

52. Shown graphically, the following is the path CRYPTSY and VERNON typically followed to steal CRYPTSY customer assets:

FOOTNOTE 2 In the cryptocurrency world, a “hot wallet” is known as a bitcoin wallet that is connected to the Internet that allows for the instant payout of withdrawals on cryptocurrency exchanges.

CRYPTSY CUSTOMER DEPOSITS FUNDS INTO DESIGNATED CRYPTSY WALLET
CRYPTSY MIXES USER DEPOSITS INTO SEVERAL CRYPTSY "HOT" WALLETS
VERNON TRANSFERS $8.2 MILLION IN BITCOIN TO COINBASE THROUGH HIS PERSONAL COINBASE ACCOUNT AND CRYPTSY'S COINBASE ACCOUNT
COINBASE LIQUIDATES THE BITCOIN, AND NOW VERNON AND THE MONEY ARE MISSING

53. Over the course of approximately three years, CRYPTSY and VERNON deposited and liquidated $4,900,000.00 worth of Bitcoin through CRYPTSY’s COINBASE account.

54. Over the same period of time, CRYPTSY and VERNON deposited and liquidated $3,300,000.00 worth of Bitcoin through VERNON’s COINBASE account.

55. CRYPTSY and VERNON told COINBASE that the $4,900,000.00 deposited and liquidated through CRYPTSY’s COINBASE account represented a portion of the revenues CRYPTSY had generated from its business, which CRYPTSY told COINBASE was the byproduct of the 0.3% transaction fee CRYPTSY assessed its customers for the value of each transaction in which the customers engaged at CRYPTSY.

56. VERNON also told COINBASE that the $3,300,000.00 deposited and liquidated through his personal COINBASE account represented Bitcoin that VERNON himself had mined and that he personally owned.

57. Based on the number of assets deposited and liquidated through CRYPTSY’s COINBASE account, with full knowledge that CRYPTSY charged its customers a 0.3% transaction fee on the value of each transaction, COINBASE could not have reasonably believed that CRYPTSY was conducting nearly $1,700,000,000.00 USD in cryptocurrency exchange trading business over the stated time period.

58. Likewise, COINBASE could not have reasonably believed that VERNON had personally mined and owned the $3,300,000.00 USD he deposited and liquidated through his personal COINBASE account. Coinbase Failed to Adequately Investigate Cryptsy and Vernon’s Coinbase Accounts and Willfully Blinded Itself to Obvious Red Flags

59. In or about June 2014, suspicions arose at COINBASE about the high volume of activity taking place in the CRYPTSY and VERNON accounts at COINBASE.

60. Notwithstanding the regulatory requirements COINBASE faced as a Money Services Business under the FinCEN division of the U.S. Treasury Department, COINBASE merely performed a cursory review of the accounts held by CRYPTSY and VERNON and asked only a few benign questions about the suspicious activity.

61. In response to COINBASE’s perfunctory inquiry, VERNON claimed Bitcoin liquidated through his COINBASE account were his own and were derived through his personal mining efforts.

62. Without follow-up or verification, COINBASE accepted CRYPTSY and VERNON’s hollow responses.

63. COINBASE failed to request from VERNON origination wallet addresses and a confirmation transaction to verify the veracity of his claims that he mined the Bitcoin.

64. Had COINBASE even cursorily audited or reviewed the blockchain FOOTNOTE3 history of the Bitcoin deposited into VERNON’s COINBASE account, it would have been open and obvious to COINBASE that VERNON’s statements were completely without merit. The following examples demonstrate the open and obvious information available to COINBASE:

DIAGRAM

65. 
For CRYPTSY and VERNON, COINBASE made specific exceptions to its internal procedures; because CRYPTSY and VERNON were “high volume” customers, as evidenced in internal communications at COINBASE. 

66. 
COINBASE purposely conducted a curtailed and inadequate investigation of CRYPTSY and VERNON’s activities because COINBASE was making a large profit from CRYPTSY and VERNON’s COINBASE transactions. 

67. 
COINBASE knew its investigation into CRYPTSY and VERNON was inadequate and accepted that inadequacy in favor of its own profit, turning a blind eye to CRYPTSY’s and VERNON’s fraudulent scheme, knowing all the while that at such time COINBASE was in a position to know of such unlawful conduct. 

68. 
It was not until almost a year-and-a-half later (October 2015) that COINBASE terminated CRYPTSY and VERNON’s accounts at COINBASE in view of some media reports detailing wrongdoing taking place at CRYPTSY. 

69. 
Before COINBASE terminated CRYPTSY and VERNON’s accounts at COINBASE, though, CRYPTSY and VERNON were able to convert approximately $8,200,000.00 of assets from CRYPTSY users – laundering those assets through COINBASE so that CRYPTSY and VERNON could convert assets in CRYPTSY customer accounts into cash in VERNON’s personal bank account. 

70. 
COINBASE had a unique window into CRYPTSY and VERNON’s scheme and watcheditplayoutas millions of dollars’worthof Bitcoinwere stolen from CRYPTSY customers. 

Coinbase Aided and Abetted Cryptsy and Vernon’s Theft 

71. COINBASE knew or should have known that the assets being liquidated through its exchange did not rightfully belong to either CRYPTSY or VERNON. 

72. COINBASE knew or should have known that the assets being liquidated through its exchange were not profits garnered by CRYPTSY in the normal operation of its business. 

73. 
Instead, COINBASE knew, or should have known, that the assets being liquidated through its exchange belonged to CRYPTSY account holders and were being converted by CRYPTSY and VERNON. 

74. 
COINBASE turned a blind eye to the crimes that it facilitated. COINBASE provided an array of essential liquidation services as a Money Services Business to CRYPTSY and VERNON with the knowledge that it was enabling CRYPTSY and VERNON to commit crimes and convert CRYPTSY client assets. 

75. 
COINBASE’s services served as a vital element of CRYPTSY and VERNON’s fraudulent scheme, and COINBASE was aware of its complicity in the fraud. 


76. COINBASE knew that it was required by federal law to disclose and report 
CRYPTSY and VERNON’s activities to law enforcement authorities and federal regulators, 
including FinCEN. However, to preserve its own profitable participation in CRYPTSY and VERNON’s scheme --from which COINBASE received fees --COINBASE knowingly turned a blind eye to CRYPTSY and VERNON’s criminal activities until, in late-2015, COINBASE ultimately decided to terminate its relationship with CRYPTSY and VERNON. 
77. 
COINBASE had the power, which it exercised, to control the general affairs of CRYPTSY and VERNON during the relevant time period and had the power, which it exercised, to directly or indirectly control or influence the specific transactions of CRYPTSY and VERNON which resulted in their primary violations of law.  

78. 
COINBASE also had the duty to stop CRYPTSY and VERNON’s crimes, yet it refused to do so because COINBASE was more interested in enriching itself, even if it meant furthering CRYPTSY and VERNON’s crimes and allowing CRYPTSY and VERNON to cause massive financial losses to hundreds if not thousands of CRYPTSY users --many of whom are COINBASE customers as well. 

79. As a Money Services Business, COINBASE has strict obligations under the Currency and Foreign Transactions ReportingAct of 1970 a/k/athe Bank SecrecyAct (the“BSA”) to monitor customer transactions and report any suspicious activities to law enforcement authorities. See 31 U.S.C. § 5311; 12 C.F.R. § 208.63. TheUSA PatriotAct of 2001 (the“Patriot Act”) reinforced this obligation and underscored the importance of implementing robust internal systems to detect and report money laundering and other suspicious activities. The regulations promulgated pursuant to the Patriot Act require financial institutions to institute an anti money-laudering (“AML”) program that includes four pillars: (i) designating an individual or individuals responsible for managing BSA compliance; (ii) a system of policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance; (iii) training for appropriate personnel; and (iv) independent testing of compliance.  12 C.F.R. § 208.63. 

80. For Money Services Businesses to comply with these obligations, the institutions have a legal obligation to fully understand their customer’s business. This “know your customer” (“KYC”) duty is imposed pursuant to 12 C.F.R. § 208.62. Institutions viewing account activity need a baseline against which to distinguish account activity that may be normal for a particular industry from account activity that might suggest an illegal enterprise. The KYC duty pre-dated the Patriot Act. Not only was it suggested by such guidelines as the Federal Reserve’s BSA Examination Manual of 1995 and Supervisory Letter on Private Banking Activities, SR 97-19 (SUP), but it was standard industry practice. 

81. At all relevant times, CRYPTSY and VERNON used COINBASE as their primary liquidator and deposited and liquidated the stolen CRYPTSY client assets through CRYPTSY and VERNON’s COINBASE accounts. 

82. Until late-2015 --at which time COINBASE finally closed CRYPTSY and VERNON’s accounts --CRYPTSY and VERNON liquidated and laundered over $8 Million representing Plaintiffs’ and other CRYPTSY customers’ assets. 

83. COINBASE knew that the activity being undertaken by CRYPTSY and VERNON was illegal. When COINBASE asked CRYPTSY and VERNON for information corroborating the legitimacyof the highvolumeofassets thatwereflowingthrough CRYPTSY and VERNON’s COINBASE accounts, CRYPTSY and VERNON gave patently ridiculous explanations that no reasonable Money Services Business would accept.  

84. 
Despite the lack of credibility in the responses given, COINBASE took no steps for approximately 18 months to shut CRYPTSY and VERNON out as COINBASE customers or to expose the illegal activities to law enforcement authorities. 

85. 
No matter how inexplicable the transaction, COINBASE dutifully and unflinchingly executed every single request from CRYPTSY and VERNON during the relevant time period; and COINBASE profited on a daily basis from the criminal conduct. CRYPTSY and VERNON were maintaining account balances preposterously suggesting that they owned and controlled assets approaching $1,700,000,000.00 in value, and COINBASE did not have the institutional moral fiber to turn down a customer who could offer the profits COINBASE could generate from those account balances. 


Coinbase Eagerly Became Cryptsy and Vernon’s Co-Conspirator 

86. To run their illegal scheme, CRYPTSY and VERNON needed a Money Services Business to: (a) provide a depository for the pilfered Bitcoin, (b) liquidate the stolen Bitcoin, and 
(c) provide CRYPTSY customers with a sense that CRYPTSY was operating a legitimate business. 

87. What CRYPTSY and VERNON also needed was a Money Services Business that would be hospitable to fraudsters --that is, an MSB that, for a price, was willing to overlook CRYPTSY and VERNON’s suspicious activity, ignore the excessive account activity, and ignore its own obligations under federal law. 

88. 
COINBASE ignored the fact that the activity in CRYPTSY and VERNON’s COINBASE accounts was grossly excessive and purported to represent an inordinate share of the Bitcoin market. 

89. 
Additionally, COINBASE ignored the simple verification process that the blockchain --which is the immutable backbone of cryptocurrency --provided. 

90. 
COINBASE failed to verify that the Bitcoin being presented by CRYPTSY and VERNON actually derived from legitimate sources --something that could have been easily verified. 

91. 
In or about June 2014, COINBASE requested information from VERNON as to the source of Bitcoin deposited into VERNON’s COINBASE account. 

92. 
Shortly thereafter, VERNON replied, stating that the Bitcoin originated from his activities prior to CRYPTSY and were from his own mining activities. 

93. 
Under the Bank Secrecy Act, COINBASE has a duty to inquire and/or report if suspicious activity is involved in transmitting money. 

94. 
COINBASE often and repeatedly transmitted money for CRYPTSY and VERNON. 

95. COINBASE received money from VERNON and converted it into Bitcoin. 

96. 
Upon information and belief, from May 21, 2013 to December 4, 2015, VERNON initiated over 800 transactions that obligated COINBASE to make some form of inquiry as to the legitimacy and legality of the transaction, and COINBASE routinely failed to make the necessary inquiry, to wit: 

* (a) 
COINBASE received two transactions from VERNON, each exceeding $100,000.00 in value, and made no inquiry, 

* (b) 
COINBASE received eight transactions from VERNON, each between $50,000.00 and $84,000.00 in value, and made no inquiry, 

* (c) 
COINBASE received 33 transactions from VERNON, each between $20,000.00 and $49,999.00 in value, and made no inquiry, 

* (d) 
COINBASE received 56 transactions from VERNON, each between $10,000.00 and $19,999.00 in value, and made no inquiry, and 

* (e) 
COINBASE received 115 transactions from VERNON, each between $3,000.00 and $9,999.00 in value, and made no inquiry. 

97. 
On or about June 14, 2014, the date of COINBASE’s request for information from VERNON and CRYPTSY, COINBASE had processed no less than 8,293 Bitcoin through VERNON’s personal account. VERNON’s COINBASE account had abalance of .04 Bitcoin and $40,916.00 U.S. Dollars. 

98. 
As of June 14, 2014, COINBASE had processed $1,222,788.00 USD of value through VERNON’s account and sent only one e-mail inquiry to VERNON and CRYPTSY. 

99. 
From June 14, 2014 until the time COINBASE finallyclosed VERNON’s account, COINBASE processed no less than 26,516 Bitcoin through VERNON’s personal COINBASE account. 


100. 
From June 14, 2014 until the time COINBASE finallyclosed VERNON’s account, COINBASE processed no less than $6,007,155.00 USD of value through VERNON’s account while liquidating over $3,000,000.00 USD into VERNON’s personal TD Bank account in Florida. 

101. 
At any point in time, with the power of the Blockchain ledger at COINBASE’s disposal, and with the additional benefit of knowing the starting point of a transaction (VERNON’s COINBASE wallet), COINBASE could have looked back at every transaction leading up to the deposit into VERNON’s account to verify that the items being liquidated were legitimately sourced. 

102. As an example of the information available to COINBASE: 

* (a) 
On or about October 13, 2014, VERNON transferred 150 Bitcoin into his COINBASE wallet (address 14ETojkW9Jif1N5XzMRYhjhgGZUimn7e3j – hereinafter the “VERNON COINBASE WALLET”). 

* (b) 
The transfer was completed and recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain and is easily searchable on the internet through tools such as https://blockchain.info, an internet website used to access information in the Bitcoin blockchain. 

* (c) 
The aforementioned transaction identification, or “hash,” is 
79b5acc1e60828b5b5c684aa2c7c88ba9f08d51218d33ac952f2239624c29953

* (d) 
A simple entry of the aforementioned “hash” into the search bar at https://blockchain.info would reveal that the 150 Bitcoin came from one wallet address: 1MSijnGgNRFKJAMweRcPCbF8whSpdyDUkm (hereinafter the “CRYPTSY DUkm WALLET” or “DUkm).” 

* (e) 
Upon information and belief, the DUkm wallet was a“Hot Wallet” used to store CRYPTSY client funds. 

* (f) 
Using https://blockchain.info, any user could click on the DUkm wallet address and discover that over 2,000 BTC have traveled through that wallet. 

* (g) 
As of October 2014, when 150 BTC (over $50,000.00 USD) was transferred into the VERNON COINBASE WALLET, an examination of the CRYPTSY DUkm WALLET would have revealed nearly a thousand micro transactions, consolidating fractions of Bitcoin into larger sums of 5, 10, or 25 Bitcoin at a time. By way of analogy, this would be akin to an automated account sweep. For example: 

* 1) Customer A deposits .45 BTC into his CRYTPSY account. 
* 2) Customer B deposits .01 BTC into her CRYPTSY account. 
* 3) Customers C through Z deposit a total of 4.54 BTC into their own individual CRYPTSY accounts. 
* 4) CRYPTSY would take all BTC from all accounts simultaneously and move them into the CRYPTSY DUkm WALLET. 

103. 
COINBASE not only would have been able to verify the source and destination of each transaction, but would have been able to see that VERNON sent $250,000.00 in BTC transactions to VERNON’s COINBASE wallet in less than a month. 

104. 
Vernon told COINBASE that he derived his funds from mining activities; however, none of the transactions within 35 links of funds in the DUkm wallet were mined coins. 

105. 
Freshly mined Bitcoins appear in the blockchain with the identifying label “No Inputs (Newly Generated Coins)” as follows FOOTNOTE14: 

DIAGRAM


FOOTNOTE14 None of the coins listed below were involved in any transaction alleged. The transaction is simply included as a demonstration to disprove VERNON’s patently false statements. 

106. 
Every transaction COINBASE received from VERNON into a COINBASE wallet could have been researched and evaluated as demonstrated above. 

107. 
It was not reasonable, during the time VERNON was moving Bitcoin into the VERNON COINBASE WALLET, for COINBASE to believe that the transactions it received were a result of anything other than aggregated account sweeps from CRYPTSY customers in light of the fact that COINBASE knew that VERNON controlled CRYPTSY account funds. 

Coinbase Quietly Terminated Cryptsy and Vernon’s Accounts 

108. In October 2015, a media report asserted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, FinCEN, the Department of Homeland Security, and other governmental agencies had officially launched multiple investigations into CRYPTSY’s business operations under heightened suspicions that CRYPTSY was engaged in a wide-spread fraudulent scheme for inappropriately gained licenses, market manipulation, selling unlicensed securities, money laundering, and many other financial violations. 

109. 
In response to the information set forth in the article, COINBASE inquired of CRYPTSY and VERNON whether the allegations were true. 

110. 
Despite CRYPTSY and VERNON’s denial of the allegations, COINBASE quietly terminated CRYPTSY and VERNON’s accounts within days of the media report’s release. 


111. COINBASE did not disclose to any of the governmental authorities purportedly investigating CRYPTSY the results of COINBASE’s own investigation into the allegations in the article. 

112. COINBASE also made no public statement that it had repudiated its relationship with CRYPTSY and VERNON or that it had reported to the governmental authorities any suspicious activity of CRYPTSY and VERNON. 

113. 
COINBASE simply employed a quiet exit strategy that separated itself from CRYPTSY and VERNON while seeking to shield itself from scrutiny of its own. 

114. 
Such scrutiny is well-deserved, though, as CRYPTSY and VERNON’s theft would not have succeeded without cooperation and assistance from COINBASE. 

FACTS SPECIFIC TO INVESTOR PLAINTIFFS 

115. Plaintiff LEIDEL, on August 13, 2014, deposited 3.9409 BTC to initially fund his CRYPTSY account.  The value of that deposit was approximately $2,112.32. 

CLASS ALLEGATIONS 

116. 
A class action is the proper form to bring Class Plaintiffs’ claims under FRCP 23.  The potential class is so large that joinder of all members would be impractical. Additionally, there are questions of law or fact common to the class, the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. 

117. 
Class Plaintiffs bring this nationwide class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of themselves and all members of the following class: 


All CRYPTSY account owners who: (1) deposited Bitcoins, alternative cryptocurrencies, or any other form of monies or currency at CRYPTSY, (2) had such currency liquidated by VERNON and CRYPTSY through COINBASE, and (3) have been denied access to their accounts and funds between May 22, 2014 and the present date. The Class asserts claims under California law as set forth in Counts I-IV below. 

118. This action satisfies all of the requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including numerosity, commonality, predominance, typicality, adequacy, and superiority. 

Numerosity 

119. Members of the Class are so numerous and geographically dispersed that joinder of all members is impractical.  

120. 
While the exact number of class members remains unknown at this time, upon information and belief, there are at least hundreds if not thousands of putative Class members.  

121. 
Again, while the exact number is not known at this time, it is easily and generally ascertainable by appropriate discovery. 


122. It is impractical for each class member to bring suit individually. 

123. Class Plaintiffs do not anticipate any difficulties in managing this action as a class action. 

Commonality and Predominance 

124. 
There are many common questions of law and fact involving and affecting the parties to be represented. 

125. 
When determining whether common questions predominate, courts focus on the issue of liability; and if the issue of liability is common to the class and can be determined on a class-wide basis, as in the instant matter, common questions will be held to predominate over individual questions. 


126. Common questions include, but are not limited to, the following: 

* (a) 
Whether COINBASE has converted the funds belonging to Class Plaintiffs and the Class Members; 
* (b) 
Whether COINBASE owed duties to Class Plaintiffs and the Class, what the scope of those duties were, and whether COINBASE breached those duties; 

* (c) 
Whether COINBASE’s conduct was unfair or unlawful; 

* (d) 
Whether COINBASE aided and abetted CRYPTSY’s breach of fiduciary duties; 

* (e) 
Whether COINBASE breached its duty of reasonable care as a money services business and a member of FinCEN; 

* (f) 
Whether COINBASE has been unjustly enriched; 

* (g) 
Whether Class Plaintiffs and the Class have sustained damages as a result of COINBASE’s conduct; and 

* (h) 
Whether Class Plaintiffs and the Class are entitled to injunctive relief. 


127. These common questions of law or fact predominate over any questions affecting only individual members of the Class. 

Typicality 

128. 
Class Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of those of the other Class Members because, inter alia, all members of the Class were injured through the common misconduct described above and were subject to Defendant’s unfair and unlawful conduct. 

129. 
Class Plaintiffs are advancing the same claims and legal theories on behalf of themselves and all members of the Class. 


Adequacy of Representation

130. 
Class Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests of the Class in that they have no disabling conflicts of interest that would be antagonistic to those of the other members of the Class. 

131. 
Class Plaintiffs are committed to the vigorous prosecution of this action and have retained competent counsel, experienced in complex consumer class action litigation of this nature, to represent them. 

132. 
Class Plaintiffs seek no relief that is antagonistic or adverse to the members of the Class. 

133. 
The infringement of the rights and the damages Class Plaintiffs have each suffered are typical of other Class members. 

134. 
To prosecute this case, Class Plaintiffs have chosen the law firms of Silver Law Group and Wites & Kapetan, P.A. These firms are experienced in class action litigation and have 
 
135. 
Class action litigation is an appropriate method for fair and efficient adjudication of the claims involved herein. 

136. 
Class action treatment is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy alleged herein; as it will permit a large number of Class Members to prosecute their common claims in a single forum simultaneously, efficiently, and without the unnecessary duplication of evidence, effort, and expense that hundreds of individual actions would require. 

137. 
Class action treatment will permit the adjudication of relatively modest claims by certain Class Members, who could not individually afford to litigate a complex claim against a well-funded corporate defendant like COINBASE. 

138. 
Further, even for those Class Members who could afford to litigate such a claim, it would still be economically impractical. 

139. 
The nature of this action and the nature of laws available to Class Plaintiffs make the use of the class action device a particularly efficient and appropriate procedure to afford relief to Class Plaintiffs and the Class for the wrongs alleged because: 

* (a) 
Defendant would necessarily gain an unconscionable advantage if it were allowed to exploit and overwhelm the limited resources of each individual Class member with superior financial and legal resources; 

* (b) 
The costs of individual suits could unreasonably consume the amounts that would be recovered; 

* (c) 
Proof of a common course of conduct to which Class Plaintiffs were each exposed is representative of that experienced by the Class and will establish the right of each member of the Class to recover on the cause of action alleged; 


* (d) 
Individual actions would create a risk of inconsistent results and would be unnecessary and duplicative of this litigation; 

* (e) 
The Class Members are geographically dispersed all over the world, thus rendering it inconvenient and an extreme hardship to effectuate joinder of their individual claims into one lawsuit; 

* (f) 
There are no known Class Members who are interested in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions; and 

* (g) 
The interests of justice will be well served by resolving the common disputes of potential Class Members in one forum. 


140. 
Class Plaintiffs reserve the right to modify or amend the definition of the proposed class and to modify, amend, or create proposed subclasses before the Court determines whether certification is appropriate and as the parties engage in discovery. 

141. 
The class action is superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. 

142. 
Because of the number and nature of common questions of fact and law, multiple separate lawsuits would not serve the interest of judicial economy. 

143. 
As a result of the foregoing, Class Plaintiffs and the Class Members have been damaged in an amount that will be proven at trial. 

FACTS SPECIFIC TO THE RECEIVER 

144. 
The Receiver is the duly appointed and acting Receiver/Corporate Monitor for CRYPTSY. 

145. 
VERNON has been ousted from control of, and no longer maintains any beneficial interest in, CRYPTSY. 

146. 
CRYPTSY is no longer VERNON’s “evil zombie,” focused on doing harm to its account holders and stealing from them the cryptocurrency they had entrusted to CRYPTSY. 

147. 
The Receiver is not bound by VERNON’s improper actions in engineering the fraud perpetrated upon CRYPSTY account holders. 

148. 
The Receiver is prosecuting this action on behalf of the individual claimholders whose assets were stolen by the since-removed VERNON, who dominated CRYPTSY and used the company for his own illegal purposes. 

149. 
Plaintiffs and the Receiver have duly performed all of their duties and obligations, and any conditions precedent to Plaintiffs and the Receiver bringing this action have occurred, have been performed, or else have been excused or waived. 

150. 
To enforce their rights, Plaintiffs and the Receiver have retained undersigned counsel and are obligated to pay counsel a reasonable fee for its services, for which Defendant is liable as a result of its bad faith and otherwise.

 * (a) A declaration from this Court that this action is a proper class action, including certification of the proposed Class, appointment of Class Plaintiffs as class representatives, and appointment of Class Plaintiffs’ counsel as class counsel; 

* (b)
