NOTE: Frontmatter of complaint excerpted out for purposes of first wrangle.
------

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the"Commission"), for its complaint against Defendants PlexCorps(a/k/a and d/b/a/ PlexCoin and Sidepay.Ca) ("PlexCorps"), Dominic Lacroix("Lacroix"), and Sabrina Paradis-Royer("Paradis-Royer") (collectively "Defendants")alleges as follows:

SUMMARY

1. This is an emergency action to stop Lacroix,a recidivist securities law violator in Canada,and his partner Paradis-Royer,from further misappropriating investor funds illegally raised through the fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale ofsecurities called "PlexCoin Tokens"in a putported "Initial Coin Offering." From August 2017 through the present, Defendants have obtained investor funds— purportedly $15 million from thousands of investors,including those throughout the United States and in this District—through materially false and misleading statements made by Lacroix individually and through entities Lacroix controls,including by promising investors returns of 1,354% in under 29 days. Lacroix and Paradis-Royer misappropriated investor funds and engaged in other deceptive acts relating to investments in the PlexCoin Token,despite having both been enjoined by a Quebec tribunal from engaging in the very conduct that is the subject ofthis action.

2. The ICO for the PlexCoin Tokens was an illegal offering ofsecurities because there was no registration statement filed or in effect during its offer and sale, and no applicable exemption from registration. The PlexCoin ICO was a general solicitation made using statements posted on the Internet and distributed throughout the world,including in the United States, and the securities were offered to the general public and have been sold to a large number ofinvestors,including many in the United States and in this District.

3. The stated purpose ofthe PlexCoin ICO was to obtain "tokenized currency" so that investors could "Take control of[THEIR]money!" Investors in the PlexCoin ICO were promised returns stemming from: (i)the appreciation in value ofthe PlexCoin Token through investments PlexCorps would make with the proceeds ofthe PlexCoin ICO and based on the managerial efforts ofPlexCorps'team ofsupposed experts;(ii)the distribution to investors of profits from the PlexCorps enterprise; and (iii) the appreciation in value ofthe PlexCoin Tokens based on efforts ofPlexCorps'"market maintenance"team, which included listing the token on digital asset exchanges. The PlexCoin Token currently trades under the symbol PXN.

4. Lacroix and PlexCorps enticed potential investors to purchase PlexCoin Tokens early on during the ICO, with promises that ifall 400 million PlexCoin Tokens for sale were sold,the early investors would reap outlandish rewards of1,354% in 29 days or less(the supposed period ofthe PlexCoin ICO),and by comparing the supposed returns to those in other ICOs or investments in cryptocurrencies—returns as high as 88,000%.

5. In connection with the PlexCoin ICO,PlexCorps and Lacroix made the following false and misleading statements,among others,for which Lacroix was responsible: (a)that the PlexCorps'"team"consisted ofa growing cadre ofexperts stationed around the world and with a principal place ofbusiness in Singapore;(b)that the identity ofPlexCorps'executives had to be kept hidden to avoid poaching by competitors and for privacy concerns;(c)that the proceeds of the PlexCoin ICO would be used to develop other PlexCorps products; and(d)that investors could expect"enormous" and "real"returns on PlexCoin Token investments.

6. Contrary to these false representations, and as Lacroix knew or recklessly disregarded,PlexCorps and the PlexCoin Token are a scam because: (a)there is no PlexCorps team,other than a handful ofLacroix's employees in Quebec working on the project, and no group ofexperts working across the globe;(b)the reason that PlexCorps did not disclose the identity ofits principal executive—Lacroix—was because Lacroix was a known recidivist securities law violator in Canada;(c)the proceeds from the PlexCoin ICO were not destined for business development but instead were intended to fund Lacroix and Paradis-Royer's expenses including home decor projects; and(d)there was no reasonable basis to project returns on
investment in Defendants' scam.

7. Lacroix and PlexCorps made and/or controlled the dissemination ofthe foregoing misstatements and omissions in various postings on the Internet and on social media,including in a"whitepaper" issued by PlexCorps in connection with the offer and sale ofsecurities during the PlexCoin ICO,and on webpages and Facebook accounts registered in their name,all of which were accessible to United States investors via the Internet during the relevant periods.

8. The funds fraudulently raised during the PlexCoin ICO have been channeled through various fiat currency accounts belonging to Defendants as well through cryptocurrency addresses under Defendants' control on various "blockchains." The fiat currency accounts include online payment services accounts in the United States that Defendants opened (directly or indirectly)in the name ofPlexCorps or its business alter egos,PlexCoin and Sidepay.Ca. Paradis-Royer herselfopened and directed the disbursement offunds from some ofthese accounts,fully aware ofor recklessly disregarding the dealings ofher partner Lacroix.

9. To skirt the registration requirements ofthe federal securities laws, Lacroix has attempted to refashion the PlexCoin Tokens as a "cryptocurrency" and likened them to Bitcoin. In reality,PlexCoin Tokens are securities within the meaning ofthe U.S. federal securities laws.

10. The illegal PlexCoin ICO has occurred despite Lacroix being the subject of previous orders by the Quebec Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal(the"Quebec Tribunal")enjoining him from future violations ofthe Quebec Securities Act,and despite having pled guilty before a Quebec court ofsecurities fraud.

11. The foregoing illegal offering also occurred despite the Quebec Tribunal issuing an injunction in July of2017 specifically directing Lacroix,PlexCorps,and certain companies under Lacroix's control,from engaging in the unregistered offering ofPlexCoin Tokens,and despite that same tribunal similarly enjoining Defendant Paradis-Royer on September 21,2017.

12. Rather than abide by the orders ofthe Quebec Tribunal and a contempt order entered against Lacroix in the Quebec Superior Court,Defendants have been openly flouting those orders and continue to sell and tout purchases ofPlexCoin Tokens. At most,a Facebook page related to PlexCorps indirectly acknowledged the Quebec Tribunal's injunctions,obtained by Quebec's Autorite Des Marches Financiers(Financial Markets Authority or"QAMF"),by offering for sale a t-shirt with a picture ofa man making an offensive gesture at the name and logo ofthe QAMF.

13. Throughout the relevant period,tens ofthousands ofinvestors,including over 1,500 transactions with investors in the United States and many in this District, have purchased approximately 81 million PlexCoin Tokens for approximately $15,000,000. Ofthose amounts, approximately $810,000 is currently held in three accounts to which Lacroix and his associates will soon gain access. Defendants have misappropriated or attempted to misappropriate at least $200,000 ofthese amounts on extravagant personal expenditures. Other amounts are believed to currently reside on Bitcoin or other blockchain addresses or wallets that Defendants control.

From at least June 2017 through the present,PlexCorps has marketed,offered,and sold investors"PlexCoin," which PlexCorps describes as"the next cryptocurrency." PlexCorps has also done and is doing business under the names PlexCoin and Sidepay.Ca.

RELATED INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES

25. DL Innov,Inc.("DL Innov")is a corporation organized under the laws of Quebec,Canada,in 2012, with a stated principal place ofbusiness in Quebec, Canada. Lacroix is the majority shareholder and President,Treasurer,and Secretary ofDL Innov.
26. Gestio,Inc.("Gestio")is a corporation organized under the laws ofQuebec, Canada,in 2013,and with a stated principal place ofbusiness in Quebec, Canada. DL Innov is Gestio's principal shareholder and Lacroix is Gestio's President,Treasurer,and Secretary.

BACKGROUND ON DIGITAL TOKENS OR COINS

27. An ICQ is a fundraising event in which an entity offers participants a unique "coin"or"token"in exchange for consideration(often in the form ofcrypto or fiat currency). 28. The tokens are issued on a"blockchain"or cryptographically secured ledger.'

29. Generally, coins or tokens may entitle holders to certain rights related to a venture underlying the ICQ,such as rights to profits,shares ofassets,rights to use certain services provided by the issuer, and/or voting rights. These coins or tokens may also be listed on online platforms,often called virtual currency exchanges,and tradable for crypto or fiat currency. Often,the coins or tokens are immediately tradable.

30. ICOs are typically announced and promoted through public online channels. Issuers usually release a "whitepaper" describing the project and the terms ofthe ICQ. To participate,investors are generally required to transfer funds to the issuer's address,online wallet, payment processor, or other account. After the completion ofthe ICG,the issuer will distribute its unique coin or token to the participants' unique address on the blockchain.

'A blockchain is a type ofdistributed ledger,or peer-to-peer database spread across a network,that records all transactions in the network in theoretically unchangeable,digitallyrecorded data packages called blocks. Each block contains a batch ofrecords oftransactions, including a timestamp and a reference to the previous block,linking the blocks together in a chain. The system relies on cryptographic techniques for secure recording oftransactions. A blockchain can be shared and accessed by anyone with appropriate permissions. The Bitcoin blockchain is an example ofa"non-permissioned," or public and open access blockchain. Anyone can download the Bitcoin open-source software and join. All participants share a single view ofthe Bitcoin blockchain, which is updated when Bitcoin network participants reach a consensus on the validity oftransactions under review. "Permissioned"or private blockchains are modifications to that model and require permissioned servers to be approved to participate on the network or to access particular information on the blockchain. Blockchains or distributed ledgers can also record what are called smart contracts, which essentially are computer programs designed to execute the terms ofa contract when certain triggering conditions are met.

31. In some instances,the coins or tokens may continue to be sold by the original issuer after the ICO has completed. In others,they may only be obtained by purchasing them on secondary markets.

FACTS 

Lacroix's History as a Recidivist Securities Law Violator in Canada

32. Since at least 2011, Lacroix has been the subject ofseveral Canadian court proceedings involving the fraudulent raising ofinvestor funds.

33. In 2011,the QAMF charged Lacroix and a company he controlled called MicroPrets,Inc.(or"Small-Loans"in French)("Micro-Frets"), with offering unregistered investments in Micro-Frets, purportedly in the loan business. On July 15,2011,a division ofthe Quebec Tribunal issued an ex parte order enjoining Lacroix and Micro-Frets from further violations. See Autorite Des Marches Financiers v. Micro-Frets, Inc..2011 QCBDR 60(QC 2011). On August 10,2011,the Quebec Tribunal rejected in all relevant parts Lacroix's request that the injunction entered on July 15,2011,be lifted. S^ Autorite Des Marches Financiers v. Micro-Frets, Inc., 2011 QBCDR 70(QC 2011).

34. On November 2,2011,Lacroix and Micro-Frets signed an undertaking representing to the Quebec Tribunal and to the QAMF that they would not conduct any additional securities transactions,including through transactions through the Internet.

35. On February 28,2013,Lacroix and Micro-Frets pled guilty before a Quebec tribunal to three counts each,including making materially false statements in connection with the offer and sale of, securities, and were ordered to pay over $25,000 Canadian Dollars in criminal penalties, arising out ofthe same scheme as the 2011 proceedings.

36. Despite his 2011 undertaking and 2013 guilty plea and conviction, Lacroix ran afoul ofthe Quebec Securities Act at least once more earlier this year. On June 13,2017,the Quebec Tribunal issued another order against Lacroix,DL Innov, Gestio,and Micro-Prets, having found sufficient evidence that Lacroix and those entities had raised over $2 million USD from over thirty investors to whom they had promised high returns ifthey invested in MicroFrets' lending business, and again enjoining them from additional securities-related transactions. See Autorite Des Marches Financiers v. Lacroix,2017 QCTMF 63(QC 2017).

Defendants Begin Marketing the PlexCoin ICQ

37. Undeterred by the foregoing actions, Lacroix launched his latest scam,the PlexCoin ICO,starting at least as early as June of2017.

38. In mid to late June of2017,on a Facebook page for PlexCoin with the Facebook address @plexcoin(the"PlexCoin Facebook Page"), Lacroix and PlexCorps announced the PlexCoin"ICO pre-sale launch"scheduled for August 7,2017. The PlexCoin Facebook Page described the PlexCoin Token as"the next decentralized worldwide cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum structure" whose"mission is to broaden the possibilities ofuses and to increase the number ofusers by simplifying the process ofmanaging cryptocurrency to the maximum."

39. On or around July 5,2017, Lacroix and PlexCorps also launched a Facebook page for PlexCorps with a Facebook address @plexcorps(the"PlexCorps Facebook Page"),in which they stated that PlexCorps consisted of"a group ofroughly forty people(programmers, engineers, cryptocurrency specialists, etc.) all independent throughout the world and oriented towards the same goal: "To increase accessibility to cryptoservices by simplifying its managing process." The same post noted that PlexCorps"decided not to reveal the identities ofour team to make sure no one is getting harassed on social media or recruited by other cr3^tocurrency companies,thus preventing the concept ofPlexCorps from being copied."

40. A later post on the PlexCorps Facebook Page stated that the PlexCorps team was "grow[ing]...every day"and that it consisted of"more than 48 all around the world."

41. Lacroix registered the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages and was at all relevant times the administrator for both accounts. A credit card account in Lacroix's name was associated with the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages. On several occasions immediately before and during the sale ofPlexCoin Tokens to the public,logins were made to both accounts from an IP address previously associated with Lacroix and his businesses,DL Innov and Gestio ("Defendants' IP Address").

42. The PlexCorps and PlexCoin Facebook Pages were accessible via the Internet to potential investors in the United States.

43. On or around July of2017, Lacroix,directly or indirectly, also launched websites for PlexCorps and PlexCoin. Lacroix registered at least some ofthese websites with an intemet service provider on or around May 24,2017,including websites with URLs http://www.plexcoin.org, http://www.plexcoin.com, http://www.plexbank.com,and http://www.plexwallet.com,and paid for these registrations in his name. These websites were accessible via the Intemet to potential investors in the United States.

44. Lacroix also registered and paid for Intemet security services with respect to the
URLs http://www.plexcoin.com, http://www.plexcoin.org, and http://www.plexcorps.com,
starting at least on July 1,2017. 

45. Like the PlexCorps Facebook Page,PlexCorps' website,accessible via the URL
http://www.plexcorps.com (the"PlexCorps Website"),described PlexCorps as"a group offorty people...all independent throughout the world and oriented towards the same goal: To increase accessibility to cryptoservices by simplifying the managing process."

46. The PlexCorps Website listed four additional products offered by PlexCorp,each with a unique logo: PlexCoin,PlexWallet,PlexCard,and PlexBank. The logo for PlexCoin linked users to PlexCoin's website at http://www.plexcoin.com(the"PlexCoin Website"),and indicated that PlexCoin was at the"Pre-Sale Waiting List" stage. The logo for the other products indicated that they were projected to be launched later in 2017 and or in 2018.

47. The PlexCorps Website also directed readers to the PlexCorps Facebook Page. 

48. From at least July 2017 through the present,the PlexCoin Website states that "PlexCorps presents: PlexCoin," which the PlexCoin Website describes as"a cryptocurrency... that has a value based on the current market." In July of2017,the PlexCoin Website announced the"ICO"for PlexCoin Tokens would begin on August 7,2017,and that the pre-sale period was currently open to potential investors. 

49. Under a section entitled "Frequently Asked Questions" on the PlexCoin Website, the answer to the question of"How to Invest?"instructed users that they would "have to enter [their] email address"so that"at the launch ofthe pre-sale on August 7,[they] will be able to buy[their]PlexCoin at a discounted price and in priority, and enjoy a return of1,354% on your investment!"

50. The PlexCoin Website explained that"[a]n Initial Coin Offering(ICO)is a derivative from the known expression IPO (Initial Public Offering, or stock market launch) which refers to cryptocurrency fundraiser. An ICO can allow the financing ofa new blockchain, but in most cases,the ICO is set up to issue a token,a coin or creating a Dapp(decentralized application)based on an already existing blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum."

51. In July of2017,the PlexCoin Facebook Page and the PlexCoin Website both announced that a"whitepaper"for PlexCoin Tokens(the"PlexCoin Whitepaper") would be available on August 4,2017,that the PlexCoin ICO "pre-sale" would begin on August 7,2017, and that PlexCoin Tokens would officially"launch"on September 5,2017.

52. Answering the question"What is the anticipated return on investment(ROI)?," the PlexCoin Website explained that the return depended "on the sale stage you will be at when purchase your PlexCoin." The PlexCoin Website further explain that the first 50 million PlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of$0.13 U.S. Dollars("USD"),the following 50 million PlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of$0.28 USD,the following 100 million PlexCoin Tokens would be sold at the equivalent of$0.53 USD,and the last 200 million PlexCoin Tokens(for a total of400 million coins sold), would be sold at the equivalent of$0.88 USD. Based on the foregoing discounting scheme,the PlexCoin Website projected that investors in PlexCoin Tokens would obtain a "projected return on investment" after 29 days, depending on where and when in the discount scheme the investor purchased PlexCoin,ofeither 1,354%,629%,332%,or 200%.

53. Elsewhere,the PlexCoin Website explained that after the 29 days ofthe pre-sale, "the value... will be 1,76 $[sic] per PlexCoin and it is from that date forward that the value should normally increase,as PlexCoin will be from that moment available on the open market." The PlexCoin Website also explained that the $1.76 USD value assumed that 400 million PlexCoin Tokens were sold during the PlexCoin pre-sale, but other materials expressed confidence that all 400 PlexCoin Tokens would be sold and stated that even iffewer were sold, investors would still reap returns that were"real" and commensurate to amounts sold.

54. From July 2017 through at least October 1,2017,the PlexCoin Website explained to investors that they would be able to purchase PlexCoin Tokens during the ICG with either USD,Canadian Dollars("CAD"),Euros,Bitcoin, Ether(which the PlexCoin Website calls "Ethereum"),and Litecoin. The Quebec Tribunal Enjoins Defendants from Continuing the PlexCoin ICG

55. On July 19,2017,the QAMF made an ex parte application to the Quebec Tribunal based on many ofthe foregoing PlexCoin Token marketing efforts and asking,inter alia,that the Quebec Tribunal enjoin Lacroix,PlexCoin,PlexCorps,Gestio,and DL Innov from offering or distributing investments in PlexCoin Tokens.

56. On July 20,2017,the Quebec Tribunal granted the QAMF's request(the "July Order")having concluded,as it explained at a later date, that the PlexCoin Token was a "security" under the laws ofQuebec,relying in part on the United States Supreme Court decision in SEC V. Howev.328 U.S. 293(1946). See also Financial Markets Authoritv v. Plexcorps, TMS,Montreal,2017-023-001 (July 20,2017); Financial Markets Authoritv v. Plexcorps, et al., TMS,Montreal,2017-023-001 (Sept. 13,2017).

57. In the July Order,the Quebec Tribunal ordered PlexCorps,PlexCoin,DL Innov, Gestio,and Lacroix to, inter alia:
a. "cease engaging directly or indirectly in any activity for the purpose of making any transaction on any form ofinvestment,
b. "withdraw any advertising or solicitation ofthe same nature as that made on the Internet sites www.plexcorps.com and www.plexcoin.com,Facebook,any Internet forums or others, or in relation to securities or any form of investment, whether advertised or disseminated,over the Internet or otherwise, directly or indirectly,[and]
c. "shut down the Internet sites www.plexcorps.com and www.plexcoin.com or any other site ofthe same nature as those sites, advertised or disseminated, directly or indirectly, by the latter or,failing that, to render them inaccessible to any IP address in Quebec so as to prevent anyone residing in Quebec from visiting these Internet sites." 58. The Quebec Tribunal's July Order also ordered a Facebook subsidiary in Canada to shut down the PlexCoin and PlexCorps Facebook Pages from accessibility in Quebec. 59. On July 21,2017,the QAMF served Defendants PlexCoin,PlexCorps,and Lacroix,as well as Lacroix's entities DL Innov and Gestio with the Quebec Tribunal's July Order and,on that day. Defendant Lacroix filed a notice ofdispute against the decision. 60. But Lacroix and PlexCorps did not abide by the Quebec Tribunal's July Order. On October 17,2017,the Superior Court ofQuebec held Lacroix in contempt ofthe July Order. Sanctions against Lacroix are currently pending for that contempt order.

Defying the Quebec Tribunal's Iniunctions,Defendants Continue to Market the PlexCoin Tokens to Investors and Begin Raising Investor Funds

61. Rather than ceasing advertisement and solicitations for PlexCoin Tokens as required by the July Order, Lacroix and PlexCorps took several steps in open defiance ofthe Quebec Tribunal's July Order including, as further detailed below,(a)publishing a "whitepaper" for PlexCoin(the"PlexCoin Whitepaper")on August 4,2017;(b)registering online payment services accounts to receive PlexCoin investor funds and receiving investor funds through those accounts;(c)shutting down the PlexCoin Website from Quebec IP addresses(but not U.S. addresses)but then registering the domain http://www.plexcoin.tech on August 18,2017; and(d) posting additional social media and online advertisements for PlexCoin,including in new Facebook accounts associated with PlexCorps and its businesses.

62. Lacroix made some ofthe foregoing attempts to evade the Quebec Tribunal's July Order by enlisting the help ofhis partner, Paradis-Royer,and by obscuring his involvement with the registration ofnew domains or accounts by using a fake name,including but not limited to "San Lee," or "See Lam," and/or using email addresses that belonged to or were under his control.

63. Paradis-Royer did her part to conceal Lacroix's involvement by,for example, registering certain digital payments accounts under her name or purporting to use those accounts for a fictional business called "Sidepay.Ca," which was really Defendants' alter ego.

64. By at least August 3,2017,the PlexCoin Website stated that"PlexCorps'team is constantly working on... developing" certain products associated with PlexCoin Tokens,such as the PlexWallet and PlexCard,and that the PlexCoin ICO would begin on August 8.

65. On or around August 4,2017,Lacroix and PlexCorps published the PlexCoin Whitepaper on the Internet, which was available to potential investors in the United States.

66. The PlexCoin Whitepaper contained PlexCoin's logo on the front page, PlexCoin's and PlexCorps'logos in the interim pages,and linked to PlexCoin's and PlexCorps' Websites and Facebook Pages.

67. The PlexCoin Whitepaper contained many ofthe same statements that Defendants previously made to investors in their various online postings through the summer of2017.

68. For example,the PlexCoin Whitepaper explained that the PlexCoin "pre-sale" would run during the 29 days from August 7through September 5,2017,but set September 10, 2017 as the"launch" for PlexCoin secondary market trading. The PlexCoin Whitepaper,like previous statements by Lacroix and PlexCorps,directed users to register for the"pre-sale" by entering their email address in the registration tab ofthe PlexCoin Website,and advised investors that they could purchase PlexCoin through USD,CAD,Euros, Bitcoin,Ether,or Litecoin.

69. The PlexCoin Whitepaper touted the"ROI after 29 days or less" of 1,354%, 629%,332%,or 200% depending on when the investor purchased. The PlexCoin Whitepaper stated that the foregoing"numbers might seem enormous,but they are real," and further encouraged investors to view a purchase ofPlexCoin Tokens as a profit-making opportunity by noting"ROI examples from previous ICOs,"including supposed returns of88,736.89%. The PlexCoin Whitepaper further stated that it"estimate[d]an approximate unitary value ofUS$8.50 before the end ofthe year 2017,and a value ofUS$ 14.00" by the end of2018."

70. The PlexCoin Whitepaper also touted the supposed experience,expertise,and size ofthe"team"that was behind PlexCorps,including by:(a)now describing PlexCorps as"a team of53 people...all over the world who have a common goal";(b)touting "[ejxperts oftheir own field bring[ing] their contribution to our ambitious project,"including"former managers ofthe finance world; prosperous company founders; specialists in private funds management;lawyers, notaries, accountants,and renowned tax experts; a business development manager;a risk management supervisor; a regulations manger; a marketing manager," and others;(c)explaining that the PlexCorps team "gathers all types ofspecialists necessary for the accomplishment ofits mission"; and(d)talking about their"specialists distribution under six categories" and touting
the "solid experience"of"team members." 

71. The PlexCoin Whitepaper insisted that the identity ofPlexCorps'"executives"
would remain hidden to protect"our projects' security" and to avoid poaching by competitors. 72. The PlexCoin Whitepaper stated that PlexCorps'"offices are currently based at
the heart ofSingapore" with a team "located all over the world."


73. The PlexCoin Whitepaper refers to the PlexCoin ICO as a means of
"crowdfunding"to raise $249,500,000. The PlexCoin Whitepaper notes that a portion ofthe funds raised in the PlexCoin ICO "will be used to develop and design PlexCorps' products."
74. The PlexCoin Whitepaper also explained the supposed uses to which the funds raised during the PlexCoin ICO would be put, noting"[t]he funds earned from the PlexCoin presale will be used according to the chart," a copy ofwhich is included as Figure 1 here.
Figure 1. Chart in PlexCoin Whitepaper Explaining Use of Offering Proceeds 

75. The PlexCoin Whitepaper explained that the 70% reference to market
maintenance meant that a "team will remain on the lookout for PlexCoin's value fluctuations when it will be launched" and "will limit the value decreases by buying ifthe value drops,"such that they "will thus guarantee a rather steady increase ofPlexCoin's value."

76. The PlexCoin Whitepaper explained that the profits ofthe PlexCorps enterprise would be distributed to the investors in PlexCoin Tokens,by noting,for example,that(a) "PlexCoin will profit from the PlexCoin sale" and promised that after collecting fees "[t]he company will then offer this profit to its members after the pre-sale;" and(b)that PlexCorps would make money from the transaction fees charged during the use ofthe PlexCard,and that this"2% revenue per transaction ensure great profitabilility[sic]"such that PlexCorps"will be able to guarantee a profit margin during the pre-sale to our founding members."

77. The PlexCoin Whitepaper contained financial forecasts for the enterprise, ranging from "conservative" estimates ofnorth of$77 million USD in profits for the fifth year ofthe enterprise,to nearly $6 billion USD in profit for that year under the"optimistic" view.

78. The PlexCoin Whitepaper promised investors that PlexCoin would be available for purchase and sale on"exchange platforms"starting on September 10,2017,and.Defendants, directly or indirectly,did in fact make PlexCoin Tokens exchangeable on a digital asset exchange platform known as Etherdelta.

79. In a November 6,2017 post on the PlexCorps' Facebook Page,investors were admonished to"wait for the official launch ofPlexCoin to sell at a better price, and also for us to launch our other services, which will have an impact on the value ofPlexCoin."

80. As further detailed below. Defendants began collecting investor victim funds in connection with the PlexCoin ICO,in contravention ofthe Quebec Tribunal's July Order,on or about August 7,2017. Although the PlexCoin ICO ran through October 1,2017,additional sales ofPlexCoin Tokens appear to continue,and total sales will have netted Defendants a combined equivalent to at least $15 million USD(based on PlexCoin's stated offering price).

81. Lacroix and PlexCorps made many ofthe foregoing statements to potential and actual investors on other online fora,including Twitter and a blog available at http://www.plexcoin.com/blog. Lacroix's and PlexCorps' Materially False and Misleading Statements and Omissions With Respect to the PlexCoin ICO

82. Many ofthe foregoing statements made in the PlexCorps and PlexCoin Websites and Facebook Pages and in the PlexCoin Whitepaper,all ofwhich Lacroix controlled, were materially false or misleading,or omitted material information.

83. For example,it was and is not true that PlexCoin or PlexCorps consisted ofteams ofdozens ofexperts in their fields,spread across the world,or with offices based in Singapore. PlexCoin is nothing more than a fraudulent scam run primarily by Lacroix and his cohorts, mostly out ofLacroix's offices in Quebec.

84. The statements about PlexCorps' use ofthe funds were also false. There was no meaningful market maintenance and no meaningful project development. Lacroix further failed to disclose that Lacroix actually used a portion ofthe proceeds to pay for personal expenses. PlexCoin is and was a fraud aimed at enriching Defendants.

85. Moreover,there was no reasonable basis for the statements that PlexCoin Tokens would be worth any amount by the end of2017 or 2018,or to tell investors they could expect certain "retum[s]on investment" between 200% and 1,354%,given that, as Lacroix and PlexCorps knew or recklessly disregarded, victims were simply investing in a scam.

86. Nor did Defendants conceal the identity ofthe individuals behind the project for reasons related to security or to avoid competition—they did so, upon information and belief, because ofLacroix's status as a recidivist securities law violator in Canada. By purposefully failing to disclose Lacroix's involvement with PlexCoin,Lacroix and PlexCorps also knowingly omitted material facts required to make their statements about the secrecy ofPlexCorps' executives not misleading.


  NUMBER 87 A reasonable investor would want to know that a repeated securities law violator such as Lacroix was behind the PlexCoin ICO, a fact that Defendants understood well.


Defendants Fraudulently Attempt to Conceal Lacroix^s Involvement with PlexCoin

88. In an Internet posting in early July of 2017 on an online forum in French called CryptoFR, a user traced the IP address associated with the user profile of a poster called "PlexCoin" to Defendants' IP Address. That user ran further searches on the owner of those entities (Lacroix), and speculated that because of Lacroix's background, the PlexCoin ICO sounded more like a fraud than a good investment idea.

89. Lacroix responded or directed one of his associates to respond to the revelations by falsely stating that Gestio and DL Innov were "appointed to manage the Francophone social networks [of] PlexCorps and nothing more"and that the allegations of Lacroix's involvement were thus "completely false." Cognizant ofthe damage the revelations on CryptoFR could do to their illegal enterprise, he then sent a letter,through counsel,demanding that CryptoFR remove the revelatory post, which CryptoFR apparently agreed to do.

90. Lacroix took other steps to conceal his involvement with the PlexCoin ICO, including instructing an employee via a text on June 14,2017"[djon't forget when you talk about plex,it's not me that did that! You don't know, you just saw it somewhere."

91. In another exchange with his cohorts, Lacroix complained that a potential online payment system set up for PlexCoin was"not confidential enough and it's too easy to trace" and that the"[qjamfcould make a purchase with their card and they'll see their money go." Indeed, Lacroix explored various options to collect victim funds in ways that were not traceable.

92. Paradis-Royer did her part to help Lacroix conceal his identity and both oftheir involvements with the fraudulent PlexCoin ICO. On August 2,2017, when Quebec authorities knocked on Lacroix and Paradis-Royer's residence to execute a search warrant,Paradis-Royer frantically texted Lacroix to inform him that the police were at the residence and that the"white
22

Case 1:17-cv-07007-DLI-RML Document 1 Filed 12/01/17 Page 23 of 35 PageID #: 23
paper is on the table"so she was"not answering." During that search,authorities found
materials used to create the website www.plexcoin.com as well as a draft ofthe PlexCoin
Whitepaper.
Defendants Obtain and Misappropriate Investor Funds
93. Investors,including investors in the United States, were permitted to invest in PlexCoin Tokens starting on August 7,2017,using a variety ofmethods,including by tendering cryptocurrency to Defendants' addresses on a blockchain, by providing credit card information through payment portals available on the PlexCoin Website,or by U.S.-based online payment processors such as PayPal,Square,Inc., or Stripe,Inc., and were permitted to tender,inter alia.
USD to make their investments.
94. The PlexCoin ICO continued until at least October 1,2017. However,Lacroix and PlexCorps appear to have been selling additional PlexCoin Tokens since.
95. On a PayPal account registered to Lacroix's name(and containing"PlexCoin"as the"business"ofthe account and https://www.plexcoin.tech as the URL),Lacroix received over $380,000 USD from August 8,2017 through September 4,2017. Many ofthese payments mention "PlexCoin-Paypal" as the subject ofthe payments.
96. Almost immediately from the first payment received on this PayPal account, PayPal flagged the account for suspicious activity and reversed most ofthe payments to the investors. Accordingly,on August 10,2017,Defendants began the process ofseeking an alternative method to obtain their victims' fiat currency. On that day,using the name"San"and email address he had previously used. Defendants,directly or indirectly, began making inquiries ofan online payments service similar to PayPal called "Shopify,"including whether Shopify would have any problems ifan account received thousands ofpayments ofvarious amounts in a
23

Case 1:17-cv-07007-DLI-RML Document 1 Filed 12/01/17 Page 24 of 35 PageID #: 24
short period oftime. During the conversation. Defendants and/or their cohorts falsely told a Shopify online representative that they had a"gaming company"and that they were selling "some item in our game"that the customers would "use...in our game."
97. On or around August 16,2017,Defendants registered an account at Shopify in the name ofDefendant Paradis-Royer, using Lacroix's personal email("Lacroix's Email Address").
98. At least as ofSeptember 10,2017, Lacroix and PlexCorps announced on the PlexCoin Facebook Page that investors could remit PlexCoin purchase payments through a service called "SidePay.Ca" making a similar announcement on a Facebook page with the identifier @PlexCoinINFORMATION. The HTML source code for the SidePay.Ca pajonent portal revealed that an investor that sought to invest in PlexCoin via SidePay.Ca was actually remitting money to Defendants'PlexCoin account at Shopify to purchase PlexCoin Tokens.
99. Defendants associated their PlexCoin Shopify account with two accounts held at Royal Bank ofCanada("RBC")belonging to Defendant Paradis-Royer. The first, which had been opened in May of2017, was associated with Defendants' Shopify account on September 1, 2017(the "First RBC Account").
100. On or about September 11,2017,Shopify placed a hold on Defendants' accounts
and notified Lacroix ofthe hold in an email addressed to Lacroix's Email Address.
101. Undaunted,Defendants opened another account at RBC in Paradis-Royer's name on September 14,2017,and associated it to the Shopify account(the"Second RBC Account").
102. In various transactions beginning on September 19,2017 and going through September 25,2017,Defendants' Second RBC Account received over $1.68 million USD from the Shopify accounts that had collected the funds received through the Sidepay.Ca portal.
24

Case 1:17-cv-07007-DLI-RML Document 1 Filed 12/01/17 Page 25 of 35 PageID #: 25
103. On September 19,2017,Paradis-Royer transferred $300,000 in CAD,the equivalent ofapproximately $246,000 USD,from the Second RBC Account to the First RBC Account. Paradis-Royer made or attempted to make immediate use ofthese funds, which belonged to PlexCoin ICG investors whose funds had moved from Paradis-Royer's Sidepay.Ca/Shopify account to the Second RBC Account and then to the First RBC Account.
104. On September 20,2017,for example.Defendants transferred $30,000 CAD from the First RBC Account to pay a personal line ofcredit that they had used for home improvements. In the three weeks prior to September 20,2017,Paradis-Royer had also written checks for nearly $100,000 CAD from the First RBC Account to pay for other home improvement expenses,including lawn services, painting services and electricians.
105. As detailed further below,the QAMF obtained an order freezing Paradis-Royer's bank accounts on September 21,2017, which caused RBC to refuse to cash other checks that Paradis-Royer had written and remitted around that date. These checks included payments for $75,000 CAD in ceramic work and approximately $52,000 CAD in aluminum work.
106. Paradis-Royer also used PlexCoin ICO investor proceeds to "reimburse" purported expenses ofDL Innov.
107. Defendants have also been obtaining PlexCoin ICO investor funds through another online payment services provider called Stripe, Inc., which is a U.S.-based entity ("Stripe")having affiliated entities in at least Canada and the United Kingdom.
108. On July 29,2017,Defendants and their cohorts registered a Euro-denominated account in the name ofthe PlexCoin Website to collect proceeds from the PlexCoin ICO(the "Stripe Euro Account").
25

Case 1:17-cv-07007-DLI-RML Document 1 Filed 12/01/17 Page 26 of 35 PageID #: 26
109. The Stripe Euro Account lists"PlexCoin"as its business,and contains an associated false bank account supposedly in the name ofone ofDefendants' associates in France. In a Skype conversation with this associate, Lacroix discussed opening a Stripe account in France and changing the associated bank information when it was time to "cash out"the proceeds.
110. As ofDecember 1,2017,the Stripe Euro Account holds approximately €262,000 (or the equivalent ofapproximately $311,000 in USD)(the"Stripe Euro Account"),obtained from approximately 890 different transactions. At least 115 ofthese transactions occurred with individuals in the United States,ofwhich some were registered to addresses within this District.
111. Logins to the Stripe Euro Account have occurred with an email that has a plexcoin.com domain and at least some such logins have been from Defendants' IP Address.
112. Due to Stripe's internal policies,transfers out ofthe Stripe Euro Account were placed on a 90-day administrative hold as ofSeptember 5,2017. The hold is set to expire on December 4,2017,at which point the funds presumably will be available to Defendants.
113. On August 31,2017,Defendants registered an additional account with Stripe in the name ofDefendant Paradis-Royer to collect the proceeds from the PlexCoin ICG,using Lacroix's Email Address,associating it to Paradis-Royer's Second RBC Account,and listing the associated business as"SidePay"(the "Stripe USD Account").
114. From approximately September 8,2017 througli September 19,2017,Defendants received over $1 million in USD in payments in the Stripe USD Account,covering nearly 5,400 different transactions. At least 1,400 ofthese transactions occurred with individuals whose
addresses were in the United States, at least two dozen of which reside in this District.
26

Case 1:17-cv-07007-DLI-RML Document 1 Filed 12/01/17 Page 27 of 35 PageID #: 27
115. Between September 18 and 20,2017,Defendants transferred approximately $900,000 in USD to the Second RBC Account in Canada from the Stripe USD Account,but approximately $211,492.38 in USD remains in that account.
116. The Stripe USD Account was temporarily suspended by Stripe on approximately September 27,2017 through January 25,2018.
117. On September 6,2017,Defendants registered a third account with Stripe, again in the name ofDefendant Paradis-Royer,to collect the proceeds from the PlexCoin ICG,this one denominated in CAD(the"Stripe CAD Account," together with the Stripe Euro Account and the Stripe USD Account,the "Stripe Accounts").
118. The Stripe CAD Account is associated to Defendant Paradis-Royer's First RBC Account,and engaged in 218 transactions totaling over $322,000 USD. Log-ins to the Stripe CAD Account were done by a user with an email belonging to Paradis-Royer and from
Defendants' IP Addresses.
119. The Stripe CAD Account currently holds over $372,000 in CAD(the USD equivalent ofapproximately $290,000),but is also temporarily suspended by Stripe until December 10,2017.
120. Together,the Stripe Accounts currently hold over $800,000 in USD as proceeds ofthe fraudulent distribution ofunregistered securities detailed in this Complaint.
121. On or about September 5,2017,http://www.plexcoin.tech stated that PlexCorps had distributed over 24 million PlexCoin Tokens and 68 million as ofSeptember 28,2017. Assuming Defendants sold the first 50 million PlexCoin Tokens at the stated offering price of $0.13 USD and the subsequent 18 million at the stated offering price of$0.28,this represents
over $11.54 million USD collected.
27

Case 1:17-cv-07007-DLI-RML Document 1 Filed 12/01/17 Page 28 of 35 PageID #: 28
122. The Ethereum blockchain indicates that two addresses received 400 million and
550 million PlexCoin Tokens on or about August 13,2017. The first address distributed over 71.4 million PlexCoin Tokens from August 22 through the present,in over 36,000 transactions.
123. The second address distributed over 10 million PlexCoin Tokens from November
3 through today in over 32,000 transactions. 124. Assuming all ofthe distributions ofPlexCoin Tokens from these addresses were
sold to investors as per the discount pricing scheme stating in the various PlexCoin ICQ marketing materials,these sales would have generated proceeds ofmore than $15 million USD (50 million PlexCoin Tokens sold at $0.13 generate $6.5 million USD,and 31 million PlexCoin Tokens sold at $0.28 generate $8.68 million USD).
Continued Harms to Investors in the United States is Threatened
125. As ofDecember 1,2017, publicly available data on the Ethereum block chain indicates daily transactions in PlexCoin up to and including December 1,2017,and over 76,000 transactions in PlexCoin through December 1,2017.
126. Defendants are in possession ofsubstantial amounts ofPlexCoin, which they continue to promote and to solicit investments in,including by secondary market purchases.
127. As ofDecember 1,2017,Defendants control the three Stripe Accounts, which are due approximately $810,000 USD. Although the Stripe Accounts are on an administrative hold, the funds will begin to be released as early as December 4,2017. Defendants also control unknown amounts ofBitcoin, Ether,or Litecoin cryptocurrency fraudulently obtained in exchange for PlexCoin Tokens.
128. On September 21,2017,the QAMF obtained an additional ex parte order from the Quebec Tribunal(the"September Order"),freezing certain ofDefendants' Lacroix and Paradis-
28

Case 1:17-cv-07007-DLI-RML Document 1 Filed 12/01/17 Page 29 of 35 PageID #: 29
Royer assets in Canada,and enjoining Paradis-Royer from engaging in any transactions with respect to securities, as the July Order had similarly enjoined Lacroix and PlexCorps.
129. But Defendants have continued to defy the Quebec Tribunal's orders,including the September Order,by misappropriating investor funds,and Lacroix and PlexCorps by continuing to make online postings marketing PlexCoin Tokens and PlexCorps.
130. For example,on October 10,2017,Lacroix launched an online forum posting "PlexCorps live updates," and on which Lacroix or his cohorts have been posting updated news about PlexCorps and the PlexCoin Token through at least November of2017.
131. Lacroix is making posts on the Facebook page @PlexCoinINFORMATION about supposed PlexCorps projects and the tradability ofPlexCoin Tokens on digital asset exchanges.
132. And,starting at least as early as November 16,2017,a new Facebook page identified as @PlexCoinWorldTeam and purporting to be located in Paris, France, mentioned PlexCorps and that PlexCoin would be "listed on as many public platforms as possible." That page also sells t-shirts depicting an individual making an offensive gesture at the QAMF.
133. As ofDecember 1,2017,both the PlexCoin and the PlexCorps Websites are live
and accessible to Internet users in the United States and in this District. FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
